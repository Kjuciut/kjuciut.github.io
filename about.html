					<p> I am 21 years old girl living and enjoying her life by the sea, in Klaipeda. Most of my life I was doing more than I needed, so one of my adult friends started to call me - HUMAN ORCHESTRA.
						From the first time that I was called like this till now, I like to describe myself with this phrase. Why though? I guess, because I have not stopped doing more stuff than I really need. For example: I am study, dancing, doing makeups, working, organising and at the same time having way to much fun.
